**Notes on Sensors and Actuators with ipython notebooks**

Andr√©s Marrugo

This repository is a collection of lecture notes and code on scientific computing and data analysis for Sensors, Actuators and their Interfaces. The lectures are written using the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), part of the [Python ecosystem for scientific computing]( http://scipy.org/ ). You can view these lectures in different ways: simply read on line by clicking on the links below; or download a single notebook or all the stuff or yet fork this entire repository using the GitHub resources and run the notebooks in your computer or in the cloud.  
I hope this material is useful to you and I am open to suggestions or comments.
