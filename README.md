**Notes on Sensors and Actuators with ipython notebooks**

Andrés Marrugo

This repository is a collection of lecture notes and code on scientific computing and data analysis for the course IMTR 1713 Sensors and Actuators taught at the [Universidad Tecnológica de Bolívar](http://www.unitecnologica.edu.co/). It is largely based on the book by [Nathan Ida](http://www.scitechpublishing.com/ida_9781613530061.htm "Nathan Ida, Sensors and Actuators 9781613530023"). The lectures are written using the [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html), part of the [Python ecosystem for scientific computing]( http://scipy.org/ ). You can view these lectures in different ways: simply read on line by clicking on the links below; or download a single notebook or all the stuff or yet fork this entire repository using the GitHub resources and run the notebooks in your computer or in the cloud. I hope this material is useful to you and I am open to suggestions or comments.

This work was inspired by the lecture notes on [Scientific Computing for Biomechanics and Motor Control by Marcos Duarte](https://github.com/demotu/BMC). This is a work in progress.
 


Introduction
